<h2>Introducing Docas</h2>

<p>Docas is a <strong>documentation service</strong> which not only <strong>documents</strong> your GitHub repo,
but also <strong>synchronizes</strong> them on new commits.</p>

<h2>How Docas Works</h2>

<p>Source files and documents are different branchs (<code>master</code> and <code>gh-pages</code> accordingly) 
of the same repo. Every time you push to GitHub, docas automatically synchronizes
documents hosted at GitHub pages.</p>

<p>The always up-to-date document site by default locates at:</p>

<pre><code>your_github_login.github.com/your_repository_name
</code></pre>

<p>will include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>A project page.</strong> The place not only perfect for keeping great ideas,
but also help forming better architecture by including effective description
for every folder and source code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Source code documents.</strong> Comments in markdown will be rendered with your
code side-by-side to help you approach a better <em>literate-style</em> programming.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>One-Time Setup</h2>

<ol>
<li>Add <code>docas</code> as your collaborator from the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks">admin panel</a>.</li>
<li>Add service hook <code>http://docas.io</code>.</li>
<li>You're there!
<ul><li>Test it with any push or press the <strong>Test Hook</strong> button.</li>
<li>First build takes longer than following synchronizations.</li></ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Being Smarter</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Start Last, Finish First!</p>

<ul><li>Do top-down and orthogonal design before coding the first line.</li>
<li>Break large, complex tasks into small, simple, intuitive, and orthogonal
tasks.</li>
<li>Design every task's detail in plain English and markdown.</li>
<li><em>According feature:</em> Docco (markdown and highlighted code side-by-side.)</li>
<li><em>According feature:</em> Browsing markdown in the project page.</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Communicate Well</p>

<ul><li>Include a concise description for every folder and source file.</li>
<li>Shape your ideas and communicate with your team using docas.</li>
<li><em>According feature:</em> Description for folders and files.</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Stay Focused When Coding</p>

<ul><li>Uncompromised engineering finally proofs your ideas.</li>
<li>Balance your design by keeping source lines of code under a maintaibable
size.</li>
<li>Docas let code speaks for itself!</li>
<li><em>Counterpoint feature:</em> SLOC statistics.</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Keep Documents Fresh</p>

<ul><li>Your time spent will be rewarded when code is maintained or enhanced.</li>
<li>Rewards come both from yourself and your team.</li>
<li><em>According feature:</em> GitHub push synchronization.</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Release It!</p>

<ul><li>Set another exciting goal to motivate yourself.</li>
<li>Have a party with your team!</li>
<li><em>According feature:</em> Try docas (beta) now!</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Supported Languages</h2>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>CoffeeScript</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>Shell</li>
<li>And suggest your favorite!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recycle Bin</h2>

<h2>Feature</h2>

<pre><code>+ For source files, write the description at the first line as:
      {COMMENT_SYMBOL}{FOUR SPACES}{THE DESCRIPTION}
+ For markdown files, write the description at the first line as:
      {FOUR SPACES}{THE DESCRIPTION}
+ For directories, the description is the description for the `README.md` in
that directory.
+ For shebang scripts, write the description as source files following the
shebang line. 
</code></pre>

<h2>Reasons of falling in love with your code</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Legibility</strong> <br />
Comments will be rendered with your code side by side. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Synchronicity</strong> <br />
comments doc and code doc will unit as one doc using docas.io to ensure Synchronous 
Update between coments and codes. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Semantization</strong> <br />
Literate comments ensure readability, smooth and natural.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understandability</strong> <br />
Be better to describe what function the code achieved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findability</strong> <br />
Be easier to find the code you want in clear comments and reasonable page layout. </p></li>
</ul>

<h3>For  Developer</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Easily find the function point of some code fragment in a hundred-line-long documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Literate comments can grasp and analysis the overall design, comb programming ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>Generated documents help you to pick up the train of thought, also make other programmers easier to 
understand the program construction process.</p></li>
<li><p>Be good for thinking, and to all view the code from a higher level. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Stop Doing</h2>

<p>Falling into the deep sea of the code，to find what you want for a long time!</p>

<p>Confusing what is a function of some code fragments has been compiled by yourself or by others!</p>

<p>Repeatedly describing and testing some codes to your partners!</p>
