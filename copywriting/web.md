#Docas
---------------------------------------
Literate Programming can be Quicker and Dirtier. 
    
    
    
##Stop Doing
Falling into the deep sea of the code，to find what you want for a long time!

Confusing what is a function of some code fragment has been compiled by yourself or by others!

Repeatedly describing and testing some codes to your partners!


#Let the code talks with you!


##Who's Docas.io
Docas.io automatically documents your GitHub repo which will be parsed as markdown to ensure 
legibility, understandability, findability and also semantization on GitHub pages.

Every time you push new commits to GitHub, docas keeps the master branch (the source codes)
and gh-pages branch (the documentation) in sync.


##How Docas.io Works
Comments will be rendered with your code side by side to encourage literate programming styled
development. Content of comments will be parsed as markdown to ensure readability, legibility, 
and also Semantization.

Literate comments will help you be easier to understand and find the source code.

It looks like talk with you in our familiar language. 

Docas.io automatically generates html documents using docco for all sources, plus a cover
page (named `index.html` by default) for your GitHub repo automatically.

Generated documents will be hosted using GitHub pages in the same repository
which can be accessed from:

    http://your_github_login.github.com/your_repository_name

Each time you push new commits to GitHub, docas.io synchronizes the documents with source 
automatically. So the documents will be always up-to-date.


##Reasons of falling in love with your code 
● __Legibility__        
Comments will be rendered with your code side by side. 

● __Semantization__      
Literate comments ensure readability, smooth and natural.

● __Understandability__   
Be better to describe what function the code achieved.

● __Findability__  
Be easier to find the code you want in clear comments and reasonable page layout. 

● __Synchronicity__ 

###For  Developer 
●  Easily find the function point of some code fragment in a hundred-line-long documentation.

●  Literate comments can grasp and analysis the overall design, comb programming ideas.

● Generated documents help you to pick up the train of thought, also make other programmers easier to 
understand the program construction process.

●  Be good for thinking, and to all view the code from a higher level. 

###For  R&D Team
●  The required source code will be quickly find by your partners for using and improvement.

●  Enhance the efficiency of the project development and follow-up maintenance. Avoid the influence 
of personnel changes or other factors leads to efficiency low and maintenance difficulties.
